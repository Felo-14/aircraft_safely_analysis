# Aircraft Safety Analysis


## Project Overview

This project aims at:

1. Identifying potential risks of aircraft.

2. Determining aircraft with the lowest risk for a company.

3. Giving insights on purchasing and operating commercial and private enterprises, for a company aspiring to expand into the aviation industry.


## Business Understanding

Our company seeks to expand into the aviation industry, and I am responsible for ensuring a successful entry by identifying the lowest-risk aircraft options for both commercial and private operations.
 
I need to delve into and analyze the potential risks associated with aircraft ownership, and provide actionable insights to guide the head of the new aviation division in making informed decisions about aircraft purchases.

Among the important questions posed throughout the analysis were:

1. For each aircraft make, how many injuries were sustained?

2. What is the overall trend of the annual number of fatalities?

3. Does the number of engines in an aircraft correlate with the number of fatalities?

## Data Understanding

The data is from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) aviation accident database.

In the `data` folder is a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamTheiation-accidentcontainsatabase-synopses), containing information from 1962 to 2022 about civil aviation accidents containing information and possessions, and in international waters from 1962 to 2022.

**The key variables used include:**
1. Make (Aircraft)
2. Total Fatal Injuries
3. Number of Engines

## Recommendations

Here are the key recommendations for the company based on the analysis made:

* The company should consider purchasing aircraft manufactured by Embraer because they were not involved in as many fatal injuries and accidents as other aircraft.

   Additionally, they are fuel-efficient, versatile, and well-suited for regional and short-haul operations.

* The company should also consider purchasing aircraft manufactured by Airbus as they suffered fewer accidents leading to fatal injuries compared to other aircraft.

   Moreover, they are renowned for reliability, fuel efficiency, and short-haul commercial flights.

* The company should consider purchasing twin-engine or quad-engine aircraft as they did not suffer as many accidents as single-engine aircraft, and they are commonly used today.

* The twin-engine aircraft is the most appropriate pick as advances in their designs have reduced the demand for quad-engine aircraft due to their better fuel efficiency.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the analysis conducted has given our company valuable insights as we enter the aviation sector. Before venturing into the aviation sector, it is crucial to consider the above recommendations in addition to other factors which can lead to future improvements.
